Problem Statement of Computer Vision 2 project:

Company X owns a movie application and repository that caters to movie streaming for millions of users on a subscription basis.
The company wants to automate the process of cast and crew information in each scene from a movie, such that when a user pauses on the movie and clicks on cast information button, the app will show details of the actor in the scene. The company has an in-house computer vision and multimedia experts who need to detect faces from screenshots from the movie scene.
